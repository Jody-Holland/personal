# Jody Holland

I am an Islands and Sustainability Erasmus Mundus Master's Graduate, with experience in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My specialisms include high-resolution remote sensing, statistical modelling in R, sustainable infrastructure, and community-based tourism. My education includes a BA in International Relations and Politics from the University of Sheffield, with international experience at the University of Mannheim, and an MSc in Spatial Sciences (Islands and Sustainability) completed as part of an Erasmus Mundus Scholarship at the University of Groningen and the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

I have experience working in research institutes like ECOAQUA in Gran Canaria and the Population Research Centre in Groningen. Proficient in R, Python, ArcGIS, and QGIS, many of my projects revolve around geospatial analysis. Outside work, I enjoy hiking, camping, and LGBTQ+ activism.
